# Spam-Ham-Detection

Project Title: Spam and Ham Detection

Project Description:

In today's digital age, email communication is integral to both personal and professional spheres. However, with the rise in unwanted and potentially harmful spam emails, there is a pressing need for effective spam detection systems. Our "Spam and Ham Detection" project addresses this challenge by developing a robust machine learning-based solution to automatically classify incoming emails as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate).

Key Objectives and Achievements:
Data Collection: We collected a diverse dataset of emails, comprising both spam and ham examples, to train and evaluate our machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing: The raw email data underwent extensive preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, to prepare it for analysis.

Feature Engineering: We engineered a rich set of features, including textual content, sender information, and email metadata, to capture important patterns and characteristics.

Machine Learning Models: Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, I developed spam detection using Rnadom Forest Model.
